      <h1 class="title-2">Arepa</h1>
      <p class="paragraph-2">
        A South American staple, particularly in Columbia and Venezuela, arepas
        are stuffed cornmeal cakes that are crispy outside and fluffy inside.
        They're a popular food item for street vendors, but are also regularly
        made in homes. Arepas are eaten at all times of the day, often as a
        snack or side dish to a main meal.
      </p>
      <h2 class="sub-title">Ingredients</h2>
      <ul class="ingredients">
        <li>
          Harinapan, which is a special pre-cooked corn flour specifically for
          making arepas
        </li>
        <li>Salt & water</li>
        <li>Butter</li>
        <li>Cheese</li>
        <li>oil for cooking</li>
      </ul>
      <h2 class="sub-title">How to make it</h2>
      <ol class="steps">
        <li>
          <p>
            Place the water, oil and salt in a large bowl. Mix to dissolve the
            salt.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li><p>Slowly add the Harinapan, mixing as you add.</p></li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Cover the bowl with a damp tea towel and let the dough rest for 10
            min. After resting, add 1 Tbsp water if the dough seems too dry to
            hold together well.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Divide the dough into 6 roughly even pieces and shape each piece
            into a Â½ inch disc (roughly 4 inches in diameter).
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Heat a cast iron griddle over medium high heat. Brush the griddle
            with a little oil and add the arepas.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Cook the arepas for 3-5 minutes on each side, just to seal the
            dough. Then, reduce the heat to medium or medium low and continue to
            cook the arepas for 8-10 minutes per side, until golden brown and
            lightly charred, reducing the heat of your griddle as necessary.
            (The arepas should be puffed slightly and sound slightly hollow when
            tapped.)
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Remove the arepas from the pan and let them cool on a wire rack for
            about 10 minutes. If you will be filling the arepas, split them in
            half, nearly all the way with a sharp knife. Stuff and serve warm!!
