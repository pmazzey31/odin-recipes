      <ul class="ingredients">
        <li>4 green plantains peeled and cut in medium sized chunks</li>
        <li>4-5 tbs butter or lard</li>
        <li>2 tbs oil canola or sunflower/li></li>
        <li>1 tbs hot pepper or chili powder</li>
        <li>1 tsp cumin</li>
        <li>
          1 cup grated cheese and/or 1 cup cooked chorizo or chicharrones (fried
          pork belly) or bacon
        </li>
        <li>Salt to taste</li>
      </ul>
      <h2 class="sub-title">How to make it</h2>
      <ol class="steps">
        <li>
          <p>Melt the butter or lard over medium heat in large sauté pan</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Add the plantain chunks and cook for about 40 minutes or until they
            are very soft, turn them about every 10 minutes, they should be
            slightly golden but not too crispy.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Sprinkle the cooked plantains with the chili powder, cumin and salt.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Transfer the plantain pieces to a bowl, do this while they are still
            hot (but be careful not to burn yourself).
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Mash the plantains using a wood masher – or just a regular potato
            masher – until you obtain chunky dough like consistency.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Form balls slightly smaller than the size of a tennis ball with the
            dough.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Make a hole in the middle of each ball and fill it with the cheese
            or chorizo or chicharrones (mixed with ground peanuts), gently press
            the filling into the hole, cover the filling and reshape it back
            into a ball shape.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Heat the oil over high heat, add the stuffed plantain dumplings and
            fry them until they are golden and crispy on each side.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Transfer to plate lined with paper towels to drain the grease and
            serve immediately.
